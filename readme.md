# Air Quality Monitoring Solution

This project is an open software / hardware air quality monitoring package.  The sensors all run on an Arduino, which sends its
captured data via http to a separate stack for analysis.  The capture and analysis stack can run on any system that supports Node + Elasticsearch.

More to come soon, I'm missing a TON of stuff.
